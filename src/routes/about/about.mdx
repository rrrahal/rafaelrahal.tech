# Hello, I'm Rafael ðŸ‘‹


Hi, I'm Rafael, a software engineer at Datadog based in Lisbon.
Over the past few years, I've focused mainly on frontend development,
but I consider myself a generalist, enjoying various aspects of software engineering.
I occasionally write about what I'm learning, so feel free to check out my blog here.
You can also connect with me on Twitter and LinkedIn.
