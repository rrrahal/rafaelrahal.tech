#### Being out of your comfort zone is like swimming with sharks
</span>

I recently changed jobs, which naturally pushed me out of my comfort zone. Whenever I'm in unfamiliar territory, I tend to question everything around me, including myself.
In a new job, you don't know the people, whether they are nice, if you'll fit in, or how they will perceive you.
This week, I thought of a very fitting analogy for this situation: swimming with sharks.


Being out of your comfort zone is like being thrown into a pool with sharks.
The first response is to quickly assess the situation and figure out the correct next steps.
You have two options: either quickly find the nearest exit and don't even try, or stay and see what happens.

Since I decided not to run, the mix of excitement and fear is thrilling. I see what seem to be big sharks swimming around, and I'm not exactly sure if I belong hereâ€”this is the infamous impostor syndrome.
But the desire to earn my spot and ultimately contribute to the ecosystem drives me to do more.
Sometimes I doubt myself but I know that's completely normal, it's important to be aware that you are new and be humble, trying to absorb all knowledge that you can.

Despite this analogy being perceived as negative, I don't actually think so. First, off course, there is no real risk involved. Second, I think that if you can use this feeling to boost you growth in a very short period of time, which is amazing.
I'm sure in a few months I'll feel like I'm swimming in an aquarium with normal fish, and that's completely okay.
Peace and tranquility are also very important for steady growth. For now, though, I'll enjoy the new phase and make sure I fit in and grow as much as possible. Let's reflect back on this one year from now.
